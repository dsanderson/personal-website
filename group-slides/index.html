						Cognitive Strategies for Design Automation

							<li>How do design automation experts decide how to integrate computers in their design process?</li>
							<li>What are the challenges and observations that motivate their decision process?</li>
							<li>Where can we share ideas, approaches and solutions between architecture and engineering?</li>

						<h2>Stats Approach (Probabalistic Programming)</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>We have a bunch of observations, $\theta_n$</h3>
						<p>Is it raining at Tanah Merah?</p>
						<p>Is it raining at Pasir Ris?</p>
						<p>Is it raining at Changi Airport?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>These observations are incomplete.</h3>
						<p>We don't directly measure wind patterns, humidity, etc.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>All of machine learning is estimating $P(X|\theta_{0..n})$</h3>
						<p>If we know it's raining in Pasir Ris and Changi, how likely is it to rain on campus in the next 5 minutes?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Bayes' Theorm</h3>
						$$P(X|\theta) = \frac{P(\theta|X)P(X)}{P(\theta)}$$
						<p>As we collect data, our guess for $P(X|\theta)$ gets more accurate</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Graphs are a more concise form of contingency tables</h3>
						<p>insert sample table and graph here</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>This is a hierarchical baysian model</h3>
						<p>You collect observations to "fit" the probability distribution of each node</p>
						<p>The less flexibility in your model, the less data you need</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Making hieirarchical baysian models</h3>
						<p>Use a library</p>
						<p>PyMC3...</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Probabalistic Programming</h3>
						<p>Our model is probability distibution, from which we can draw samples</p>
						<p>We can generalize beyond a DAG</p>
					</section>

						Geometric approach
					</section>
					<section>
						Core assumption: Our data lives in some lower-dimensional manifold in higher-dimensional space.</br>
						The goal of our ML system is to discover and reverse this embedding, letting us examing and work the data in its "true" form.
