# About Me

I'm David Anderson, a PhD candidate in the Design Innovation group at Singapore University of Technology and Design.  My research is on design automation, particularly for robotics and aerospace.  In my spare time I work on projects that span from goofy to dangerous, including robots, lighting displays, IoT and machine learning.  I've decided I finally need to enter 2005 with a personal website to chronicle these misadventures.
